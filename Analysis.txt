Quick sort is a sorting algorithm which uses divide and conquer method to sort the array of elements.
It uses pivot and partition the array into sub-array to sort the elements.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: when the pivot element is at the middle of array then we get two equal sub-array then the sorting is faster and takes minimum time to sort the elements.
Worst Case: When the selected pivot element is smallest or largest element then the sub-array will be unbalanced and it takes maximum time to sort the elements.

Merge Sort is more faster and efficient than quick sort when the array size is smaller.
And Quick Sort is more faster and efficient than merge sort when the array size is larger.

Advantage of Quick Sort is it is fast and easy to implement
Disadvantages of Quick Sort is it is unstable

Conclusion: Quick sort uses Divide and conquer to sort the elements.
Faster way to sort the elements and its average time complexity is O(nlogn).
